# *Sequence detector using finite state machine [FSM]*

## * What is a sequence detector?*

#### A sequence detector is a digital circuit that is used to detect a specific sequence of bits. This sequence can be a specific pattern of bits, or it can be a specific string of bits. A sequence detector can be used to detect a specific code, or it can be used to detect a specific message.




## *How does it work?*

#### A sequence detector is a digital circuit that is used to detect a specific sequence of bits. It is usually used in communication systems to detect a specific code that has been transmitted. The sequence detector will output a 1 if the specific sequence of bits is detected, and will output a 0 if the sequence is not detected.
